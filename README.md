# Patient N-Counter - Learning to code for the web

Originally called Patient Encounter Counter, I switched it to Patient N-counter. Creates a more mathematical looking name and not so repetitive.

Simple counter for me to enter the number of patients I saw on a particular shift.

**Step one:**
Create MERN stack for online Patient N-counter
- Learn javascript
- learn server-side database with MondoDB
- learn Node.Js, ReactJs (client-side) and ExpressJS (server-side)
